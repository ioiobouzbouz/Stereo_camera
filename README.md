# Stereo_camera (BU406m cameras)
Code for the use of software synchronized Toshiba BU406m camera (64-bit build)

Helps get bursts of images for 1min at 20Hz with 30min interval (can be changed depending on purpose of the study)
Need to have a folder with lib/TeliCamUtl64.lib and TeliCamApi64.lib as well as include/TeliCamApi.h and TeliCamUtl.h + other headers if needed

Where the .exe file is created, place the TeliCamUtl64.dll and TeliCamApi64.dll files
